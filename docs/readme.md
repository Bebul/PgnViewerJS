This part of PgnViewerJS is only for constructing a web site that will document the possibilities and give examples. You will find that web site [here](https://mliebelt.github.io/PgnViewerJS/index.html).

Don't use these files as examples that could be easily adapted, because they are only provided to show the features nicely. Use instead the examples that can be found under `modules/pgn-viewer/examples`.
