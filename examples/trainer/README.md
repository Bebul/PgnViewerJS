# In a nutshell

This directory shows some examples I use in the work of providing exercises to my training group. It goes like that:

* Take a template like the 3 examples here.
* Use minimal additional CSS to style the boards.
* Bring them in a form you are able to print them out later.
* Now find the right examples, some short text, to have exercises for them.

Have fun!
